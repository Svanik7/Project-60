    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>is Cricket</h2>
          <p>The reason why i like cricket most is mainly the rules of the game which are much more interesting than any other game in the world. As a cricket player i can do anything like batting,bowling,wicketkeeping and fielding but the enjoyment of hitting the ball with bat is a very sweet movement for a batsman.</p>

          <h1>My Favourite books</h1>
          <h2>is Wimpy Kid</h2>
          <p>Diary of a Wimpy Kid is famous for tickling the funny bones of both little and grownup readers, partly because Greg is so irresistibly relatable. ... “Humor is a very powerful teaching tool, and these books have gotten some reluctant readers to want to read because they're funny and a little absurd,” says Pimentel.</p>
          <section id="My Work">
          <h1>My Work</h1>
             <h2>is to do coding</h2>
              <p>1: I love to code because it is usable art.
Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.</p>

                  <h1>My inspiration</h1>
                  <p>Inspiration is deeper than motivation. It stems from passion, from being influenced by something or someone in such a way that you want to change things, do things, be things. Motivation, in the moment, can seem powerful, but its power is faded compared to the brilliance that is inspiration.</p>
